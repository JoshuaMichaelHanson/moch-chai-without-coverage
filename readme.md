# CS 633 Mocha Chai Without Coverage
**Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of unit testing!**  
Using the JavaScript test framework [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and BDD/TDD assertion library [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) we will execute 
tests for the classic game rock-paper-scissors. This is a simple example that does not contain code coverage.  
In the next example we will expand on this and show how to add another library that will allow us to see how much 
of our code is covered by tests.  
  
## Getting Started

### Preferred Method: GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a complete, configurable dev environment in the cloud that works with your GitHub repository. This is the **preferred method** for working with this project as it will make the next assignment easier to complete.

To use GitHub Codespaces:

1. Navigate to the GitHub repository in your browser
2. Click on the green "Code" button
3. Select the "Codespaces" tab
4. Click on "Create codespace on main"
5. Wait for the codespace to initialize (this may take a minute)
6. Once loaded, you'll have a fully configured VS Code environment in your browser
7. You can run and test the application directly from the codespace

### Alternative Method: Clone Repository Locally

If you prefer to work locally:

1. Ensure you have Git installed on your machine
2. Open your terminal or command prompt
3. Clone the repository using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd repository-name
   ```

## How to run ##
Simply open the index.html in a browser. If you're using GitHub Codespaces, you can right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server" or similar option.

Make changes and see them instantly live reload!
  
Cheers!
