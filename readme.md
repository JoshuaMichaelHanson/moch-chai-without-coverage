# CS 633 2021 Spring 1
**Hello and welcome to the wounderful world of unit testing!**  
Using the JavaScript test framework [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and BDD/TDD assertion library [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) we will execute tests for the classic game rock-paper-scissors. This is a simple example that does not contain code coverage.  In the next example we will expand on this and show how to add another library that will allow us to see how much of our code is covered by tests.  
  
  
Once you have re-mixed the project with Glitch it is your own personal copy and you can edit, explore and learn freely!
